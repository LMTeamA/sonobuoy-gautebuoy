\section*{Introduction} Here is presented the theoretical derivation of
the analog instrument response of the digitizer. The digital filtering
during AD conversion is briefly discussed, but its properties are well
defined in the manual of the ADC.

\section{Hydrophone decoupling}
\begin{figure}[h]

  \caption{Hydrophone decoupling circuit}
  \label{fig:hydrophone_decoupling}
\end{figure}

The figure above (\ref{fig:hydrophone_decoupling}) shows an equivalent
circuit of the deployed input decoupling to the hydrophone.

\begin{align*}
  C_1 &= 47 \mu F \\
  C_2 &= 380 pF \\
  R_1 &= 58.33 k \Omega \\
  R_2 &= 41.67 k \Omega
\end{align*}

\paragraph{}The circuit was based on the suggested decoupling in figure
\ref{fig:suggested_decoupling} seen below, it was designed to have the
same properties, but also low-pass the signal at cutoff frequency
$f_{LP_1}$. The original design already decouples, and high-passes, the
signal at frequency $f_{HP}$.

\end{figure}

\section{Derivation of transfer function}

$i_1$ and $i_2$ signify the current loops passing through respectively left
and right loop. Using Kirchoff's equation:

\begin{align}
  \label{eqn:currents_1}
  V_s &= i_1 (Z_{C_1} + Z_{R_1}) + (i_1 - i_2) \cdot Z_{R_2} \\
  0   &= (i_2 - i_1) \cdot Z_{R_2} + i_2 \cdot Z_{C_2}
  \label{eqn:currents_2}
\end{align}

$V_s$ is the signal source, the hydrophone. See separate data sheet for
hydrophone frequency response. $V_o$, output, is measured at the
terminals $T_+$ and $T_-$.

\begin{align}
  \label{eqn:vo}
  V_o &= i_2 \cdot Z_{C_2} \\
  H(s) &= \frac{V_o}{V_s}, s = i\omega
\end{align}

Solving for $H(s)$ gives:

\begin{equation}
  H(s) = \frac{45115.36 s}
  { (s + 1.083 \times 10^5)
    (s + 0.2128) }
  \label{eqn:transferfunction}
\end{equation}

A bode plot of the transfer function (instrument response) is shown in
figure \ref{fig:bodeplot} below.
\begin{figure}[h!]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=400px]{bodeplot.png}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Bode plot of transfer function, showing peak response at
  $33.9$ Hz.}
  \label{fig:bodeplot}
\end{figure}

Equation \ref{eqn:transferfunction} can be solved by using the MATLAB
script response.m (listing \ref{code:response_m}), the Bode plot in figure \ref{fig:bodeplot} was created with the same script.

\subsection{Analysis}
The initial frequency band of interest reaches
from periods of 20 s (0.05 Hz) to approximately $100$ Hz. The analog input part as
well as the configuration of the analog-digital converter has been
configured to as best and simple as possible to record the signal
within this frequency band.

\subsubsection{Decoupling and analog high pass filter}
The transfer function is a bandpass filter with
the suggested decoupling creating a high-pass filter with corner
frequency at $f_{HP} = 0.0339$ Hz or a period of $29.4985$ s.

\subsubsection{Low pass filter and operational amplifier}

To avoid aliasing due to the speed of the opamps (operational
amplifiers) in the signal path; the OPA627 (see \cite{opa627_ds} and
figure \ref{fig:hydrophone_decoupling}) acting as buffer with
unity gain and then the OPA1632 \cite{opa1632_ds} at the input terminals
of the ADS1282EVM \cite{ads1282evm_ds}.
An additional low pass stage is added with a corner frequency of
$f_{LP_1} = 17.189 $ kHz. The speed of the opamp is in the order of Mhz
so this corner frequency should be well within their capabilities.

\paragraph{OPA1632} \ \\
The OPA1632 \cite{opa1632_ds} is set up with a 1 nF capacitor in its
feedback loop on the ADS1282EVM \cite{ads1282evm_ds}, this low passes
the signal with an cut off frequency at $f_{LP_2} = 151.99$ kHz. Its
gain bandwidth is specified to be 180 MHz, given that the gain is 1 and
the load is large it should have a well defined response. The
OPA1632-setups simplified transfer function is \cite{fully_diff_opamps}:

\begin{equation}
  H_{OPA1632}(s) = \frac{9.551 \times 10^5}
                        {(s + 9.551 \times 10^5)}
  \label{eqn:opa1632_tf}
\end{equation}

\paragraph{OPA627} \ \\
The OPA627 is used as a buffer with gain 1 to provide a high impedance input and low
impedance output. It has a gain bandwidth product of 16 MHz at this
gain \cite{opa627_ds}. With the first low pass filter, $f_{LP_1}$, well
below this it should be able to relay the signal without problems. The
transfer function would simply be 1 for this step. It is important that
the OPA627 has well mounted bypass capacitors to avoid oscillations when
configured for this low gain. An buffer designed for unity gain, like
the OPA633 \cite{opa633_ds} or BUF634 \cite{buf634_ds} could prove a better choice.

\paragraph{OPA633} \ \\
The OPA633 \cite{opa633_ds} is a strong candidate for an drop-in replacement of the
OPA627, it is specifically designed to be a buffer working at unity
gain. The feedback loop is internally connected. But otherwise the same
wiring scheme applies. Closely mounted and well chosen bypass capacitors
are still needed on the power supplies to ensure stability. The input
impedance of the ADS1282EVM should be sufficient to for the gain to
approach unity. The OPA633 has a gain bandwidth of 260 MHz, however it
requires $\pm 15$ mA current, which is about twice that of the OPA627.

\subsubsection{Stability}
The system, $H(s)$ from equation \eqref{eqn:transferfunction}, is
passive and has all
its poles in the left half plane and is stable.

\subsubsection{Analog-Digital Converter (ADC)}
The ADS1282EVM equips its ADS1282 with a crystal with the recommended clock frequency of
$f_{clk} = 4.096$ Mhz \cite{ads1282evm_ds}. This results in a modulator
output speed of $ f_s = f_{clk}/4 = 1.024$ Mhz \cite{ads1282_ds}. The
Nyquist frequency is then: $f_{Nq} = 1.024 \times 10^6 / 2 = 512 $ kHz.

\subsubsection{Anti-alias filter}
The 10 nF capacitor used on the ADS1282EVM
\cite{ads1282evm_ds}, results in a low-pass filter with an upper corner frequency of $f_{LP_3} =
\frac{1}{2 \pi \times 600 \times 10 \times 10^{-9}} = 26525.82 $ Hz
\footnote{Equation (3), p.15, \cite{ads1282_ds}; \citetitle{ads1282_ds}}.

$f_{LP_3}$ is thus well below $f_{Nq}$ and any signal component above $f_{LP_3}$ should
be almost completely damped before it reaches $f_{Nq}$, resulting in no
or very small aliasing effects.

This equation represents the upper low pass filter:
\begin{equation}
  H_{UL}(s) = \frac{1 \div 600 \times 10 \times 10^{-9}}
                   {(s + 1 \div 600 \times 10 \times 10^{-9})}
            = \frac{1.667 \times 10^5}{(s + 1.667 \times 10^5)}
  \label{eqn:transfer_upper_lowpass}
\end{equation}

The complete analog transfer function is then:
\begin{equation}
  H_{analog} = \frac{7.1817 \times 10^15}
                { (s + 9.551 \times 10^5)
                  (s + 1.667 \times 10^5)
                  (s + 1.083 \times 10^5)
                  (s + 0.2128) }
  \label{eqn:transfer_analog}
\end{equation}

With the following frequency response:
\begin{figure}[h!]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=400px]{bode_complete_analog.png}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Frequency response of complete analog system, equation
    \eqref{eqn:transfer_analog}.}
  \label{fig:bode_complete_analog}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Output of decoupling and buffer} The output is scaled by $-7.6\ \text{dB} =
0.4169 \frac{V}{V}$ which is to scale the input from $\pm 6V$ to $\pm 2.5V$, $0.4169
\approx 5 / 12 = 0.4167$, which is the input range of the ADS1282EVM
(\cite{ads1282evm_ds} and \cite{ads1282_ds}) in bipolar mode. The
slightly inaccurate scaling is due to available resistor values.

\label{digitalfilter}
\section{Digital filter}
Further the ADS1282 is configured to digitally filter the decimation
output so that the final output signal of 250 Hz contains no alias. The
built-in sinc and FIR filters are activated, see the ADS1282 datasheet
\cite{ads1282_ds} for details. The high pass filter has been
set to filter at $f_{HP} = 0.05\ \text{Hz} = 20s$.

\paragraph{}The
ADS1282 can be configured for an sample rate of as high as 4000 Hz
\cite{ads1282_ds}. This would be possible without changes in the analog interface, although it would come at an cost of resolution.

\section{Hydrophone characteristics}
Refer to the datasheet of the AQ-18 \cite{aq_18_ds} for the frequency response of the
transducer (including its built-in preamplifier).
