  == History ==
  2012-07-07: Signal back to normal, did several measurements, but nothing
              nothing found. Could be loose contact or oscillations due to
              unconnected terminals. Considered to be in good shape.
  2012-07-06: Signal, unconnected does not make sense.
  2012-06-25: Initial test: all components working.
  2012-06-21: Finished build.
