  2012-06-25: Initial test: all components working.
  2012-06-25: Must fix: Appears to be some digital crosstalk on signal.
              Solution: Solder point on Olimexino D11 (DOUT) was not
              good. Small ball on top. Re-heating, and properly heating
              Olimexino-socket makes solder align properly.

  2012-06-21: Finished build.
